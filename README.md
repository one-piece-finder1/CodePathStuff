## App Brainstorming (Step 4)
1. Messages app on iOS
   - reaction effects especially the background effects for occasions and the message effects.
   - smoothness and seamlessness and clutter-free UI
   - text messages and IMessages all in one place
2. Discord
   - server channels - very convenient to talk about different things but keep everything separate       
     but in the same place
   - the ease with scaling Discord for a large number of users - I have all communications in one     
      Place: friends, clubs, big company servers, etc.
3. Brave iOS app
   - ad blocker that blocks all trackers and ads on a website and therefore gives a very clean and 
     clutter-free browsing experience.
   - ability to easily save YouTube videos in a Brave ‘playlist’ and watch them offline


My app idea:
I would like to improve on the settings app on iPhone. The specific thing in the app that I would like to improve is how you can search for a specific setting. When searching for a specific setting, I think that many times I can’t find the setting in the search results when I search and I 
need to go check every single setting manually to find the required setting. Other times, I don’t know if a specific setting is even available, and also now I need to manually check all the settings to figure this out. My feature to solve these problems would be to make the search bar in 
such a way that it can also act as a chatbot and answer simple questions about different settings like how exactly I can find a setting and if a given setting is even present.

## Notes

Even though the CodePath description for XCode was pretty good and easily understandable, I still had some difficulty navigating it and took a little time to understand how everything was structured.
